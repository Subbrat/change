        <h3>Project Elaboration - In-house Publication Platform</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This idea was born when we were unable to find a perfect publisher who not only publishes the work,
                secures the
                copyright and ethics, but also will have multiple-tier write-ups ranging from the level of applied daily
                life
                sciences to deep subatomic and molecular sciences, with no format restriction.</li>
            <li>All in a very cost-effective or no-price but also providing the other things which did not exist in the
                global
                science environment. Hence, I decided to create one!</li>
            <li>This project establishes the network of all the research scholars in the top research institutes in
                India and
                the scientists in those institutes.</li>
            <li>Every member can send their write-up to the firm which will get reviewed and published with proper
                ethics and
                impact, irrespective of individual, group, club, community in their desired format - no restriction of
                knowledge!</li>
            <li>The product which handles this workflow of taking documents from people to giving to the reviewer and
                return of
                review and criticism post publication, stats of analytics, linked papers, will be a live server-based
                application.</li>
            <li>I am aiming to create this product, the documentations, protocols, the approach, and networking for the
                same to
                be a benefit of the research environment, scientific writing community of research students with very
                low or no
                cost.</li>
            <li>Researchers are not restricted to IISER Berhampur; membership is permanent and free of cost with the
                provision
                of critical review and research management protocol.</li>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This project was started a month back as an idea, when the position of POC and
            election was
            not announced, which was a coincidence, and I am committed to developing this project as one of my biggest
            projects!
